// PONER AQUI QUE PARTES ESPECIFICAS A HECHO CADA UNO

Guillem:
I implemented the initial version of the doAction method, specifically a
    rewrite of the Actions.OPEN section, the implementation of Actions.LOCK,
    Actions.UNLOCK and Actions.UNLOCK_SHORTLY sections.
A new variable String variable named "locked" was created, that indicated
    the current status of the selected door, as in if it was locked or
    unlocked.
This new variable was added inside the Door constructor with all doors starting
    with value "locked".

Lucas:
I implemented all the areas design, first of all, i removed the DirectoryDoors class and I created the new Directory area.
This new class contains the node root that contains all the others areas 'representing a tree'.
with this implemented, I created the new abstract class 'Area' where I have had to create some abstract methods like getDoorsGivingAcces and findAreaById.
this class extends two new classes that I already make: Partition(contains an array of other areas) and Space(contains an array of the different doors that gives acces to an Area)
in both classes I implemented the abstract methods, his attributes and constructors.
Also I have modified the Door constructor so that when creating a door the areas it connects are needed to add the door to the area that gives access
