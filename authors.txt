Guillem:
I implemented the initial version of the doAction method, specifically a
    rewrite of the Actions.OPEN section, the implementation of Actions.LOCK,
    Actions.UNLOCK and Actions.UNLOCK_SHORTLY sections.
A new variable String variable named "locked" was created, that indicated
    the current status of the selected door, as in if it was locked or
    unlocked.
This new variable was added inside the Door constructor with all doors starting
    with value "locked".
